1.1 â€“ Automated input and output of galaxies in ImageFIT.py, with 3 models for each: Sersic, Double Sersic, and Sersic+Exponential. Removed individual galaxy folders from main directory.
2.0 - Converted all .py scripts to .ipynb files. Separated automated steps into cutout, masking, and fitting. Generalized piping to work on multiple systems with minimal modification. Attempted a fix of masking functions.
